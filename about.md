Welcome to a friendly space where I share pieces of my everyday life alongside the ideas and research topics that shape my curiosity. I am currently a master's student, and this micro-blog is where I document the thoughts, interests, and moments that matter to me — both personal and academic.

**Microblogging** is my brain which is chaotic, excited, and deeply curious. Nothing here is “finished,” but everything here is honest.
