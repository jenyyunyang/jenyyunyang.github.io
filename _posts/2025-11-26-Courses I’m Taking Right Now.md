Since it’s my first semester of grad school, I’m taking the general courses that everyone begins with. For example, Introduction to Communication, Methodology, and Statistics. Right now we are getting close to the end of the term, so things are pretty hectic, but it feels like I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be and do.
