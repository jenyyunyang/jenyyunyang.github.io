It hasn't rained this fresh since I came back to Korea. In Korea, most of the rain falls during the hot summer months, so I found myself missing the rain that comes with cooler weather. 
Because of that the first thing I miss about Seattle is the rain. It's so fresh and has a unique smell that clears my mind. That clean scent combined with the crisp air and petrichor (the earthy smell after rain, or "흙내음") is what I long for most.
